# Functional and Non-Functional Requirements for Donation Management Software

With the help of AI (Chat GPT), we asked what would be some of the functional requirements our software would need. The AI gave us these results:

1. **User Registration and Management**: Allow users to create accounts, manage their profiles, and securely log in.

2. **Donation Processing**: Provide a user-friendly interface for donors to make donations. This may include options for one-time or recurring donations, choice of payment methods (credit/debit card, PayPal, bank transfer, etc.), and the ability to specify donation amounts and purposes.

3. **Donor Management**: Allow organizations to manage donor information, including contact details, donation history, and communication preferences.

4. **Campaign Management**: Enable organizations to create and manage donation campaigns, including setting fundraising goals, tracking progress, and promoting campaigns through various channels.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**: Provide comprehensive reporting and analytics features to track donation activity, monitor campaign performance, and gain insights into donor behavior.

6. **Integration with Payment Gateways**: Integrate with payment gateways to securely process online payments and handle transactions in real-time.

7. **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect donor information and ensure secure transactions, including encryption, data backup, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

8. **Communication Tools**: Include features for sending automated thank-you messages, donation receipts, and updates on campaign progress to donors via email or other communication channels.

9. **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with mobile devices to allow donors to make donations conveniently from smartphones and tablets.

10. **Accessibility**: Design the software with accessibility features to ensure that individuals with disabilities can easily navigate and use the platform.

11. **Customization and Branding**: Allow organizations to customize the software's appearance and branding to maintain consistency with their own brand identity.

12. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Integrate with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to streamline donor management and improve communication and engagement with supporters.

13. **Multi-currency Support**: Support multiple currencies to facilitate donations from supporters worldwide.

14. **Tax Receipt Generation**: Automatically generate tax receipts for donors to facilitate tax deductions for charitable contributions.

15. **Admin Dashboard**: Provide an administrative dashboard for organizations to manage users, campaigns, donations, and other aspects of the system efficiently.

## Criticizing the AI

As expected, some of those are actually non-functional requirements, like: Security, Mobile Compatibility, Customization and Branding, and Accessibility, which aren't what we're looking for as of now.

The AI also showed us some functional requirements in which we won't be able to implement as of now, like: Multi-currency Support.

It also gave us a requirement (Admin Dashboard) which is almost identical to 2 other requirements: Donor Management and Campaign Management.
